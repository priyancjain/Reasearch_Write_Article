# MultiAgent: Automated Research & Article Writing with AI Agents

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to orchestrate multiple AI agents to collaboratively research and write articles on complex topics. Leveraging frameworks like CrewAI, LangChain, and OpenAI, the system automates the process of gathering information, synthesizing insights, and generating well-structured content. The project is implemented in Python using Jupyter notebooks.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/priyancjain/Reasearch_Write_Article.git
   cd MultiAgent
   ```
2. **Set up a Python environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Ensure you are using Python 3.10–3.13 for compatibility with CrewAI and other dependencies.

## Usage
- Open the main notebook (`Final_Research_Write_Article_v3.ipynb`) in Jupyter Lab or Notebook.
- Follow the instructions in the notebook cells to run the multi-agent workflow.
- Generated articles and results will be saved as `.md` and `.txt` files.

## File-by-File Overview
### 1. `Final_Research_Write_Article_v3.ipynb`
- **Purpose:** Demonstrates the creation of a multi-agent AI system for research and article writing. Introduces agents, tasks, and sequential orchestration.
- **Features:** Uses Python 3.11, installs dependencies, and provides a step-by-step workflow.

### 2. `ai_topic_result.md`
- **Purpose:** Markdown file containing a sample article on Artificial Intelligence, generated by the system.
- **Features:** Covers AI trends, key players, news, ethics, and a call to action.

### 3. `ai_topic_result.txt`
- **Purpose:** Plain text version of the AI article.
- **Features:** Same content as the markdown file, for plain text use cases.

### 4. `requirements.txt`
- **Purpose:** Lists all Python dependencies for the project.
- **Features:** Ensures reproducibility and easy environment setup.

### 5. `.ipynb_checkpoints/`
- **Purpose:** Jupyter's auto-save directory for notebook checkpoints.
- **Features:** Contains backup versions of all main notebooks and result files.

## Sample Output
See `ai_topic_result.md` and `ai_topic_result.txt` for a sample article generated by the multi-agent workflow. These files demonstrate the system's ability to research, synthesize, and write on advanced topics like Artificial Intelligence.
